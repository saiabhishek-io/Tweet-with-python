# Tweet-with-python
With the power of Selenium Automation, this is a simple project that Logs into Twitter with your credentials, and then opens up the Tweet box, enters your desired text, and hits the tweet button. This project isn't the final version. I have several updates coming up adding different functionalities to the code. 

Requirements: 
1. python3, selenium and webdriver (your choice, chromedriver/ geckodriver, anything works.)
To install Selenuim:
           pip3 install selenium (for Linux and MacOS)
           pip install selenium  (for Windows users)
2. creds.py file, with the credentials (optional) you can store your credentials in the same code (its bad practice) or you can make a creds.py with the credentials and import it. Check the files for more. 


Note: Sometimes you might encounter exceptions/ error as the twitter webpage https://twitter.com changes time to time. If you get error, simply run the code again. 
I will add a fix for it soon.
